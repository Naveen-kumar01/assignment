# assignment
The project works in the flow of -
1. The EDA ipython/jupyter notebook which provide the analysis part of the project.

2. The second is the ipython/jupyter notebook named (Data Merging to generate final dataset) - this notebook works on the data merging of temperature.csv and AC_data.csv.

3. Then the two notebooks with the single and all AC's power consumption forecasting is done using the LSTM model.

4.Then the multivariate forecasting is done using the same LSTM model for the forecasting of all AC's simultaneously with the avg temperature.

5.The last is the multivariate forecating using the fbprophet library by facebook, there were environment issues so implementation is done in the pycharm ide, the instruction are given to proerly use the module.
